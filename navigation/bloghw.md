## Night at the Museum Experience 

## What I saw 
[At night of the museum, there were many different classes that showed their work throughout this school year. In the computer science class, people from CSSE, CSA, and CSP showed the differnt types of projects that they had worked on during this trimester. They talked about the different types of obstacles they went through, and how they overcame this. Outside of the classrom, I saw many things that were made from other electives like ceramics, art from the drawing and painting class, and work done by the photography students.]


## Here is n@tm through my perspective:
