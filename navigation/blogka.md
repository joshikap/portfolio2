# JavaScript Lessons & Homework

## Arrays Lesson (taught by me)


### Key Concepts:
- Arrays store multiple values in order
- Access elements by their index (starting from 0)
- Use loops to iterate through array elements
- Can perform operations on each element

---

## Booleans Lesson


## [Link to booleans hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-01-20-booleans-lessons.ipynb)

### What I learned:
- Booleans are one of the most fundamental data types in programming
- A boolean can only have two values: true or false
- Used to make decisions in code and control the flow of programs

---

## Data Abstraction Lesson

## [Link to data abstraction hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-01-09-data_abstraction.ipynb)

### What I learned:
- Data Abstraction simplifies complex systems by showing only the essential features and hiding complex details, so users can easily understand and interact with systems or apps

---

## Nested Conditionals Lesson 

## [Link to nested conditionals hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-1-14-Nested-Conditionals%20(1).ipynb)

### What I learned:
- I learned how nested conditionals allow me to place an if or else statement inside another if statement to check multiple conditions in a structured way.
- I learned how to use nested conditionals to make more specific decisions, such as checking a second condition only after the first condition is true.
- I learned the importance of proper indentation and organization so my nested conditionals are easy to read, understand, and debug.

## Mathematical Expressions Lesson 

## [Link to mathematical expressions hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-01-20-math-exp.ipynb)

### What I learned:
- I learned how to write and evaluate mathematical expressions using numbers, variables, and operation symbols like +, -, ×, and ÷.
- I learned how to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) to correctly simplify expressions step by step.
- I learned how to translate word problems into mathematical expressions to solve real-life situations.
---

## Iterations Lesson

## [Link to iterations hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2025-10-08-iteration-homework.ipynb)

### What I learned:
- I learned that iterations repeat a set of instructions multiple times using loops like for and while.
- I learned how to control the number of repetitions by using counters, ranges, or conditions inside a loop.
- I learned how iterations make programs more efficient by avoiding repeated code and automating repetitive tasks.

## JSON Lessson

## [Link to JSON hw](https://github.com/joshikap/student/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-01-16-json_lesson.ipynb)

### What I learned:
- I learned that JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange information.
- I learned that JSON uses key–value pairs, with keys in double quotes and values that can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
- I learned how to read and write basic JSON structures, including objects {} and arrays [], to organize data clearly.
---

## Strings Lessson

## [Link to Strings hw](https://github.com/joshikap/portfolio2/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-01-27-Strings-homework.ipynb)

### What I learned:

- I learned that strings are sequences of characters used to store and work with text in a program.
- I learned how to create strings using quotation marks (" " or ' ') and how to combine them using concatenation.
- I learned how to manipulate strings using methods like finding length, changing case, and accessing specific characters by index.

---

## Classes and Methods Lesson

## [Link to Classes and Methods hw](https://github.com/joshikap/portfolio2/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-1-27-ClassesAndMethods-Lesson.ipynb)

### What I learned:

- Classes are a template for creating something. It defines what properties and behaviors the object should have.
- For example the class car would define the color, the model, year released, etc.
- Methods are an action that an object executes.

---

## Variables Lesson

## [Link to Variables hw](https://github.com/joshikap/portfolio2/blob/main/_notebooks/2026-02-19-variables.ipynb)

### What I Learned:


- A variable is a container where you store stuff. Think of it like your lunchbox: let lunchbox = "sandwich";

- Meaning: let → When creating a new variable you use let
